Introduction

This repository contains Python scripts and a tutorial to guide you through analyzing e-commerce data using PostgreSQL, Polars, DuckDB, and PySpark. You'll learn how to load CSV data into a PostgreSQL database, perform data cleaning and exploration using Polars ,Pandas and DuckDB, and conduct in-depth analysis using PySpark.

Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL using: sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Polars: Install Polars using pip: pip install polars
Pandas: Install Pandas using pip: pip install pandas
DuckDB: Install DuckDB using pip: pip install duckdb
PySpark: Install PySpark using pip: pip install pyspark
Jupyter Lab: Install Jupyter Lab using pip: pip install jupyterlab
Setting Up the Environment
Create a PostgreSQL database: Follow the PostgreSQL documentation to create a new database.
Load CSV files: Use the provided Python scripts to generate CSV files for the e-commerce data. Load these CSV files into your PostgreSQL database using polars.

Tutorial Steps
Data Exploration with Polars:

Connect to the PostgreSQL database using Polars.
Load the data into Polars DataFrames.
Perform basic data exploration, such as checking data types, summary statistics, and missing values.
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Data Analysis with DuckDB:

Create a DuckDB database.
Load the data from PostgreSQL into DuckDB.
Perform more advanced data analysis tasks, such as aggregation, grouping, and joining.
Explore DuckDB's query language and performance optimizations.
Scalable Analysis with PySpark:

Set up a PySpark environment and connect to a Spark cluster (if applicable).
Load the data from PostgreSQL into a Spark DataFrame.
Perform large-scale data analysis tasks, such as machine learning, graph analysis, and real-time processing.
Explore PySpark's distributed computing capabilities and performance optimizations.
Jupyter Lab Usage
Launch Jupyter Lab: jupyter lab
Create a new notebook.
Import necessary libraries (Polars, DuckDB, PySpark).
Write Python code to connect to the database, load data, and perform analysis.
Run cells to execute code and view results.
